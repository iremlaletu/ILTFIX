                The parts used in your repairs typically come from various sources:
                OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) Parts: Sourced directly from the phone manufacturer, ensuring high quality and compatibility. 
                Aftermarket Parts: Third-party alternatives to OEM parts, usually cheaper but varying in quality.
                Refurbished or Used Parts: Salvaged from recycled or damaged phones, offering a more affordable option.
                Generic or Generic-Compatible Parts: Generic components claiming compatibility, but quality may vary.
